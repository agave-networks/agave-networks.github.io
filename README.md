# How to Edit things:


## Team Members 
```
go to _data/team_members.yaml
to change the picture substitute it in images/team (the name has to be the same)
edit the text for each member
the rest is taken care by the engine ;)
```

## Posts
```
go to _posts
add a new .md file in the format yy-mm-dd-name.md
the posts appear in inverse cronological order (newest to oldest) so choose the date accordingly.
insert the flags present in the other posts they are used to properly visualize the posts.
```
