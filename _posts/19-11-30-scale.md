On Agave Networks, we believe that the approach on solving global waste critical situation should not be on increasing efficiency on waste management, but on tackling the root-cause problem: waste production. 
Organizations across the supply chain of manufacture, commercial and distribution industries, connected to the AI powered network, will optimize their added value activities, by creating a connection with the actual market demand. By creating a connection among real businesses demands with supplierâ€™s capabilities, industrial and commercial uncertainty decreases. The network has the potential of creating an optimal production environment, known as industrial ecology. Businesses will benefit by decreasing overall activity costs and potentially eliminate commercial and industrial waste generation.
